# Bike Purchase Analysis Project

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the factors that influence individuals' bike purchases. 
By examining various demographic and economic variables, I aim to uncover insights that can inform the cycling industry's marketing strategies and product development.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a crucial step in ensuring the integrity of the analysis. The following actions were taken to prepare the data for analysis:

### Removing Duplicates:
All duplicate entries were identified and removed to ensure each record was unique.

### Standardizing Values:
The columns for marital status and gender were cleaned up to avoid confusion. The values:

M -> Married,
S -> Single,
M -> Male,
F -> Female

### Formatting Income Data:
The income column was adjusted to decrease the number of decimal places for easier readability.

### Unit Conversion:
Commute distances were converted from miles to kilometers to standardize the measurement system.

### Creating Age Ranges:
A new column for age ranges was created to categorize individuals based on their age.

## Pivot Tables
Several pivot tables were created to analyze the relationships between different variables and bike purchases:

### Income Level and Purchases:
The first pivot table examines the relationship between income levels, gender, and whether an individual purchased a bike.

### Commute Distance and Purchases:
The second pivot table analyzes the effect of commute distances on bike purchasing behavior.

### Age Brackets and Purchases:
The third pivot table explores how age brackets relate to bike purchases.

## Dashboard Creation
A dashboard was created to visualize the insights from the pivot tables. This includes:

Pivot Tables: Key pivot tables are displayed to summarize findings.
Slicers: Interactive slicers were added to allow users to filter data based on specific criteria, enhancing user engagement and analysis capabilities.
